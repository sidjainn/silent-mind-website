          <h1>Why Silent Mind?</h1>
          <p>Because there is continuous chatter. The mind gets dispersed because of readily available digital distractions. This makes deep rest and creativity suffer, slowly at first, and over time creates a degenerative cycle of negative emotions and poor mental health, often physical also. It may be experienced as dullness, poor energy, lack of clarity, and disinterest.</p>

        <h3>What is Silent Mind</h3>
        <p>Silent mind is the cultivation of centeredness, improved reception (transistor analogy), and being at rest even while being in action. It needs conscious effort at first but can slowly become a state. It is experienced as in the form of better energy levels, lightness, harmony, and more frequent moments of inspiration.</p>

        <h3>Why do it in a group</h3>
        <p>People coming together has something magical to it. The common intentionality amplifies the journey for all individuals. Groups provide the opportunity to share experiences while pursuing a similar goal. This creates connection, provides support, and integrates new insights.

          <h3>Why am I interested</h3>
          <p>I lived in Auroville for 5 years and got to experience the power of small communities very closely. I was part of a self-discovery program for young adults that had some very powerful elements - especially sharing circles that brought people closer. This was 5 years ago, now it’s coming back in my life in an interesting way.            
            <ul>
                <li>I am seeking a more intentional community around me</li>
              <li>I have an urge to provide something meaningful for others</li>
              <li>It is a helpful way for me to be at practices I otherwise find challenging to follow on my own</li>
            </ul>
            That being said, it is mostly the power of the tools, facilitation is not such a huge part and can be easily replicated.

        <h3>What did we do last time?</h3>
        <p>We did a check-in, a short guided meditation to slow down the mental activity, 
            <br><br>
            journaling with the idea to witness and stream thoughts and emotions, while being in a relatively centred state.
            <br><br>
            After, we did a sharing circle - having to articulate something that's alive helps people feel lighter, in some cases see the thing more clearly, feel heard, supported, and connected. It can also initiate a healthy conversation. The commonality of challenges & experiences makes one feel less isolated in their journey. It's a great way to regulate emotion and perspective!

            Doing the next one on similar lines, put in your details on the link if you are interested. You can also express interest for future gatherings.
